# Information
C# and C++ versions both run the exact same and share the same fileworks which means you can switch from either one without having to worry about saves...

Your money cannot go over int32 max value or about 2 billion.
Points and taxes also cant go over 2 billion.

When you launch the game there will be an "Assets" folder in C:\ReaperGame\ which that folder is also created...
Move the items from the assets folder in the github to the assets folder in "C:\ReaperGame\Assets".

C# version of the game requires the music so if you dont want music you will have to use the C++ version.
